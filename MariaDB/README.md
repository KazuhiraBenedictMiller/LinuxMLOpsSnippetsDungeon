## ‚ñ™Ô∏è MariaDB ü¶≠

**Local Installation:**
	
	> $ sudo apt update
	> $ sudo apt install mariadb-server
	> $ sudo mysql_secure_installation

Then access the DB:

	> $ sudo mariadb
	
OR

	> $ mariadb -h YOUR_HOST_NAME -u username -ppassword database_name

Where to connect locally you simply put localhost and the credentials you'll setup eventually with the command below.
<br>
If you want to connect to a remote DB, you'll have to enter the IP address of the remote db.
<br>
database_name is optional.

Setup User and Grant Privileges (While inside MariaDB):

	> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 
**‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE:** When granting privileges the current configuration 'user'@'localhost' means that you are giving privileges for user on connections from the current host.
<br>
If you would like to actually connect from another IP with user, you'd need to change 'localhost' with 'ip_address' where ip_address is the address where you would like to connect remotely from.
<br>
Also, you can simply put the wildcard '%' like 'user'@'%' to grant privileges on user connecting from any ip_address.

**Docker:**

First, mkdir for a MariaDB dir and cd into it:

	> $ mkdir MariaDocker
	> $ cd MariaDocker

Pull the MariaDB Docker Image:

	> $ sudo docker pull mariadb

Create Container:

	> $ sudo docker run -p 3306:3306 --name mdb -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mariadb:latest

Get into MariaDB CLI (and into the Container running it):

	> $ sudo docker exec -i -t mdb mariadb -u root -ppassword

To Connect to a Local Docker Image running MariaDB from outside the Container but on the same Machine:

Get the Docker Container IP Address :

	 > $ sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' MARIA_DB_CUSTOM_CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME

Where the CUSTOM_CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME is the one you've assigned with --name flag in docker run

Connect then to MariaDB from outside the container, but locally (Outside the Container, but same machine from MariaDB-Client):

	> $ sudo mariadb -h DOCKER_IP_ADDRESS -u MARIADB_USER -pMARIADB_PASSWORD

**Accept External Connections from different IP/Machines - BOTH Local and Docker:**

Locate the 50-server.cnf file, usually located in 
	
	/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d 

Then cd into the folder.

Edit the File with a Text Editor (Nano will do fine):

	> $ apt-get update
	> $ apt install nano
	> $ nano 50-server.cnf

Find and set the bind-address to 0.0.0.0 and comment out (with #) the line skip-networking (if in the file):

	Replace: #bind-address 		= 127.0.0.1 
 	With: bind-address = 0.0.0.0

Then restart the local DB with:

	> $ sudo systemctl restart mariadb

OR with (can also be used inside MariaDB Container /bin/bash Shell):

	> $ sudo service mariadb restart

OR, restart the Container:

 	> $ sudo docker restart MARIA_DB_CUSTOM_CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME

Locate your IP Address with:

	> $ ip a

Connect to MariaDB and Create a new that can connect from anywhere with all permissions when connecting from anywhere:

	> CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Grant necessary privileges to User:

	> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Where * . * stands for ALL_DATABASES, You can also use db_name*.* to only let the user use the database db_name.

Apply Changes:

	> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

**‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE:** On Docker the line bind-address in 50-server.cnf is usually already commented out.

**‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE:** In some cases, for connecting from an external machine, you might also have to configure the Firewall to accept external connection from a list of trusted different IP Addresses and open the Port (in this case 3306) to listen for incoming connections.

In those cases:

	> $ sudo ufw allow from remote_IP_address to any port 3306

OR (unsafe):

	> $ sudo ufw allow 3306

Then:

	> $ sudo ufw reload

If you're handling sensitive data, make sure you know exctly what you're doing.

Eventualy, enroll in some courses regarding Networking and Security.
 
**Check that everything was successful**

Run an Ubuntu empty container with:

	> $ sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu bash
	
Then:

	> $ apt-get update
	> $ apt-get install mariadb-client

Connect to Remote MariaDB Server:

	> mariadb -u your_username -h host_ip_addr -pyour_password

**To Use MariaDB with Python:**

	> $ sudo apt install libmariadb3 libmariadb-dev
	> $ pip install mariadb

TO CONNECT MARIA DB to a MySQL Workbench:

Launch a MariaDB container
Pull the latest MariaDB image

bash
Copy
Edit
docker pull mariadb:latest
Run the container, mapping container‚Äôs MySQL port (3306) to the host, and setting up credentials:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d \
  --name mariadb \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=SuperSecretRootPass \
  -e MYSQL_USER=appuser \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=AppUserPass \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=myappdb \
  mariadb:latest
-d
Run detached in the background

--name mariadb
Gives the container a friendly name

-p 3306:3306
Exposes container‚Äôs 3306 on host‚Äôs 3306

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD / MYSQL_USER / MYSQL_PASSWORD / MYSQL_DATABASE
Bootstrap your initial database and users

Verify it‚Äôs running

bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
You should see a line like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND    ...  PORTS                   NAMES
abc123def456  mariadb:latest "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp  mariadb
2. Test connectivity via CLI
Before firing up MySQL Workbench, ensure the server is reachable:

bash
Copy
Edit
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -p
Host: 127.0.0.1 (avoids socket vs TCP confusion)

Port: 3306

User: root (or your chosen $MYSQL_USER)

Enter the $MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD when prompted

If you see the MariaDB [(none)]> prompt, you‚Äôre good to go.

3. Configure MySQL Workbench
Open MySQL Workbench

Create a new connection

Click the ‚Äú+‚Äù next to MySQL Connections

Connection settings

Field	Value
Connection Name	mariadb-docker (any)
Connection Method	Standard (TCP/IP)
Hostname	127.0.0.1
Port	3306
Username	root (or your user)
Password	Store in Vault‚Ä¶ ‚Üí enter SuperSecretRootPass

Test Connection

Click Test Connection

You should see Successfully made the MySQL connection

Save and Open connection

4. (Optional) Fine-tuning & Troubleshooting
Bind-address in MariaDB
If you customized MariaDB‚Äôs my.cnf, ensure bind-address = 0.0.0.0 so it listens on all interfaces.

Docker network
If you have multiple containers and want them to talk internally, create a user-defined bridge:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker network create mynet
docker run -d --network mynet --name mariadb ‚Ä¶ mariadb:latest
Then other containers on mynet can reach mariadb:3306 by hostname.

Firewall
If you run ufw or firewalld, make sure port 3306 on localhost is allowed.

Using localhost vs 127.0.0.1
MySQL Workbench‚Äôs ‚ÄúStandard TCP/IP over SSH‚Äù can misinterpret localhost as a socket. Stick with 127.0.0.1.

Logs & Errors

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs mariadb
Check for any startup or authentication errors.

5. Connecting from Other Hosts
If you later need to connect from a different machine on your LAN:

Change the -p flag to bind on a specific interface, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
-p 192.168.1.42:3306:3306
In MySQL Workbench, set Hostname to your host‚Äôs LAN IP (e.g. 192.168.1.42).

Make sure your MariaDB user is allowed to connect remotely:

sql
Copy
Edit
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myappdb.* TO 'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'AppUserPass';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
