### Troubleshooting SSH Connection to a remote GitHub repo.

If you've created an SSH key but are still being prompted for a password when pushing to GitHub, it's likely because your repository is still configured to use HTTPS instead of SSH for remote operations. Here's how you can address this issue:

1. **Check Remote URL**: First, check if your repository is using SSH or HTTPS by running `git remote -v` in your repository directory. This command will list the remote URLs for fetch and push operations. If the URLs start with `https://`, it means your repository is configured to use HTTPS.

2. **Change Remote URL to SSH**: If your repository is using HTTPS, you need to change the remote URL to use SSH. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

   Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with the name of your repository. This command changes the remote URL to use SSH, which should allow you to push without being prompted for a password, assuming your SSH key is correctly set up.

3. **Ensure SSH Key is Added to GitHub**: Make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account. You can check this by going to your GitHub account settings, navigating to the SSH and GPG keys section, and verifying that your SSH key is listed there. If it's not, you'll need to add it.

4. **Start SSH Agent and Add SSH Key**: Ensure that the SSH agent is running on your machine and that your SSH key is added to it. You can start the SSH agent and add your key with the following commands:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   Replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the path to your SSH key if it's different. This step ensures that your SSH key is available for use by Git.

5. **Test SSH Connection**: You can test your SSH connection to GitHub by running:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   If the connection is successful, you should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." This confirms that your SSH key is correctly set up and recognized by GitHub.

By following these steps, you should be able to push to GitHub without being prompted for a password, as long as your SSH key is correctly set up and added to your GitHub account.
