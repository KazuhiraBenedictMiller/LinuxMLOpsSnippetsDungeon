# Welcome to the Dungeon bro.

Ever had that brain freeze moment in the Linux terminal, searching for that one command you've used a thousand times for your MLOps/DataOps infrastructure? 

Fear not, here you have a wealth of curated commands and code snippets!

### How Does it Work?

Every folder contains a treasure trove of reusable snippets curated for Debian and Debian-based distros. 
Simply copy-paste the snippets and commands for effortlessly installing and managing containers, databases, frameworks, and more!!

Most of the folders also contain a Super-Dummy code example (mostly in Python - sorry, not sorry) that explains the basic functionalities for that given tool and that can be used as boilerplate.

Have fun!
